### New Feature: Speech-to-Text Dictation

Added comprehensive dictation feature for system-wide speech-to-text with automatic pasting at cursor location.

**Core Features:**
-   Push-to-talk recording (hold keyboard shortcut to record, release to transcribe)
-   Automatic text pasting at cursor in any application
-   Floating widget with real-time audio waveform visualization
-   Searchable dictation history with 30-day retention
-   Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)
-   Fully offline operation with privacy-first design

**Technical Implementation:**
-   Platform-specific global keyboard hooks (macOS: Cmd+Shift+Space, Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Alt+S)
-   Real-time microphone capture at 16kHz mono via cpal
-   Audio feedback beeps (750Hz start, 500Hz stop)
-   Direct text input APIs (preserves clipboard):
    -   macOS: AXUIElement API
    -   Windows: SendInput API
    -   Linux: X11 XTest / Wayland support
-   SQLite-based history database with full-text search
-   Automatic punctuation via Whisper configuration
-   5-minute maximum recording duration with auto-timeout
-   ESC cancellation support

**User Interface:**
-   New "Dictation" settings section with microphone/model selection
-   Floating widget with collapsed (5px Ã— 30px) and expanded states
-   Hardware-accelerated animations (60fps target)
-   New "Dictation History" tab with search, edit, copy, and delete
-   Comprehensive permission request dialogs with remediation instructions

**Performance:**
-   < 2 second transcription latency (small model, typical clips)
-   < 100ms history search with database indexes
-   Minimal battery impact when idle (< 0.1% per hour)
-   Fixed memory footprint (< 10 MB audio buffer + model size)

**Testing:**
-   98 unit tests across all dictation modules
-   10 integration tests for end-to-end workflows
-   Cross-platform validation on macOS, Windows, and Linux

**Documentation:**
-   New `docs/dictation.md` user guide
-   Updated `CLAUDE.md` with dictation architecture details
-   Comprehensive troubleshooting section
