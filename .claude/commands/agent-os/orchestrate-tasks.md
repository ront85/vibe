# Process for Orchestrating a Spec's Implementation

Now that we have a spec and tasks list ready for implementation, we will proceed with orchestrating implementation of each task group by a dedicated agent using the following MULTI-PHASE process.

Follow each of these phases and their individual workflows IN SEQUENCE:

## Multi-Phase Process

### FIRST: Get tasks.md for this spec

IF you already know which spec we're working on and IF that spec folder has a `tasks.md` file, then use that and skip to the NEXT phase.

IF you don't already know which spec we're working on and IF that spec folder doesn't yet have a `tasks.md` THEN output the following request to the user:

```
Please point me to a spec's `tasks.md` that you want to orchestrate implementation for.

If you don't have one yet, then run any of these commands first:
/shape-spec
/write-spec
/create-tasks
```

### NEXT: Create orchestration.yml to serve as a roadmap for orchestration of task groups

In this spec's folder, create this file: `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/orchestration.yml`.

Populate this file with with the names of each task group found in this spec's `tasks.md` and use this EXACT structure for the content of `orchestration.yml`:

```yaml
task_groups:
  - name: [task-group-name]
  - name: [task-group-name]
  - name: [task-group-name]
  # Repeat for each task group found in tasks.md
```

### NEXT: Ask user to assign subagents to each task group

Next we must determine which subagents should be assigned to which task groups.  Ask the user to provide this info using the following request to user and WAIT for user's response:

```
Please specify the name of each subagent to be assigned to each task group:

1. [task-group-name]
2. [task-group-name]
3. [task-group-name]
[repeat for each task-group you've added to orchestration.yml]

Simply respond with the subagent names and corresponding task group number and I'll update orchestration.yml accordingly.
```

Using the user's responses, update `orchestration.yml` to specify those subagent names.  `orchestration.yml` should end up looking like this:

```yaml
task_groups:
  - name: [task-group-name]
    claude_code_subagent: [subagent-name]
  - name: [task-group-name]
    claude_code_subagent: [subagent-name]
  - name: [task-group-name]
    claude_code_subagent: [subagent-name]
  # Repeat for each task group found in tasks.md
```

For example, after this step, the `orchestration.yml` file might look like this (exact names will vary):

```yaml
task_groups:
  - name: authentication-system
    claude_code_subagent: backend-specialist
  - name: user-dashboard
    claude_code_subagent: frontend-specialist
  - name: api-endpoints
    claude_code_subagent: backend-specialist
```

### NEXT: Ask user to assign standards to each task group

Next we must determine which standards should guide the implementation of each task group.  Ask the user to provide this info using the following request to user and WAIT for user's response:

```
Please specify the standard(s) that should be used to guide the implementation of each task group:

1. [task-group-name]
2. [task-group-name]
3. [task-group-name]
[repeat for each task-group you've added to orchestration.yml]

For each task group number, you can specify any combination of the following:

"all" to include all of your standards
"global/*" to include all of the files inside of standards/global
"frontend/css.md" to include the css.md standard file
"none" to include no standards for this task group.
```

Using the user's responses, update `orchestration.yml` to specify those standards for each task group.  `orchestration.yml` should end up having AT LEAST the following information added to it:

```yaml
task_groups:
  - name: [task-group-name]
    standards:
      - [users' 1st response for this task group]
      - [users' 2nd response for this task group]
      - [users' 3rd response for this task group]
      # Repeat for all standards that the user specified for this task group
  - name: [task-group-name]
    standards:
      - [users' 1st response for this task group]
      - [users' 2nd response for this task group]
      # Repeat for all standards that the user specified for this task group
  # Repeat for each task group found in tasks.md
```

For example, after this step, the `orchestration.yml` file might look like this (exact names will vary):

```yaml
task_groups:
  - name: authentication-system
    standards:
      - all
  - name: user-dashboard
    standards:
      - global/*
      - frontend/components.md
      - frontend/css.md
  - name: task-group-with-no-standards
  - name: api-endpoints
    standards:
      - backend/*
      - global/error-handling.md
```

Note: If the `use_claude_code_subagents` flag is enabled, the final `orchestration.yml` would include BOTH `claude_code_subagent` assignments AND `standards` for each task group.

### NEXT: Delegate task groups implementations to assigned subagents

Loop through each task group in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` and delegate its implementation to the assigned subagent specified in `orchestration.yml`.

For each delegation, provide the subagent with:
- The task group (including the parent task and all sub-tasks)
- The spec file: `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/spec.md`
- Instruct subagent to:
  - Perform their implementation
  - Check off the task and sub-task(s) in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md`

In addition to the above items, also instruct the subagent to closely adhere to the user's standards & preferences as specified in the following files.  To build the list of file references to give to the subagent, follow these instructions:

#### Compile Implementation Standards

Use the following logic to compile a list of file references to standards that should guide implementation:

##### Steps to Compile Standards List

1. Find the current task group in `orchestration.yml`
2. Check the list of `standards` specified for this task group in `orchestration.yml`
3. Compile the list of file references to those standards, one file reference per line, using this logic for determining which files to include:
   a. If the value for `standards` is simply `all`, then include every single file, folder, sub-folder and files within sub-folders in your list of files.
   b. If the item under standards ends with "*" then it means that all files within this folder or sub-folder should be included. For example, `frontend/*` means include all files and sub-folders and their files located inside of `agent-os/standards/frontend/`.
   c. If a file ends in `.md` then it means this is one specific file you must include in your list of files. For example `backend/api.md` means you must include the file located at `agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`.
   d. De-duplicate files in your list of file references.

##### Output Format

The compiled list of standards should look something like this, where each file reference is on its own line and begins with `@`. The exact list of files will vary:

```
@agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
@agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md
@agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md
@agent-os/standards/backend/api/authentication.md
@agent-os/standards/backend/api/endpoints.md
@agent-os/standards/backend/api/responses.md
@agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md
@agent-os/standards/frontend/responsive.md
```


Provide all of the above to the subagent when delegating tasks for it to implement.
