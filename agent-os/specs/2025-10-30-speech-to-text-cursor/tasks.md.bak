  - [ ] 11.2 Analyze test coverage gaps for dictation feature only
    - Identify critical end-to-end workflows lacking coverage
    - Example: Full flow from keyboard press → recording → transcription → paste → history
    - Focus ONLY on this feature's requirements (not entire app)
    - Prioritize integration points between components
  - [ ] 11.3 Write up to 10 additional strategic tests maximum
    - Test: End-to-end dictation workflow (press shortcut → speak → release → text pasted)
    - Test: ESC cancellation doesn't create history entry
    - Test: 5-minute timeout creates history entry
    - Test: Empty transcription doesn't paste but may log to history
    - Test: Widget state synchronizes with backend state
    - Test: Settings changes immediately affect behavior
    - Test: Microphone disconnect during recording handles gracefully
    - Test: Multi-monitor shows widget on correct screen
    - Test: Rapid keyboard shortcut presses are debounced
    - Test: Cross-platform keyboard shortcut consistency
    - Focus on integration points, NOT exhaustive coverage
  - [ ] 11.4 Run feature-specific tests only
    - Run ONLY dictation feature tests (approximately 69 tests total when complete)
    - Use `cargo test --release` for Rust tests (performance critical)
    - Do NOT run entire application test suite
    - Verify all critical workflows pass

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All feature-specific tests pass (approximately 69 tests)
- End-to-end workflows verified
- No more than 10 additional tests added
- Testing focused exclusively on dictation feature

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Cmd+Shift+Space (CRITICAL: Changed from Cmd+S due to conflict with Save)
- **Accessibility Permissions**: Required for text pasting and keyboard hooks
- **APIs**: AXUIElement, CGEvent, Carbon/Cocoa event taps

### Windows
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Ctrl+Alt+S
- **APIs**: RegisterHotKey, SendInput, GetForegroundWindow
- **Permissions**: Microphone (Windows 10+ privacy settings)

### Linux
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Ctrl+Alt+S
- **APIs**: X11 (XGrabKey, XTest), Wayland (limited support)
- **Permissions**: Input group membership, PulseAudio/PipeWire

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Platform-specific keyboard hooks**: May have OS version differences
2. **Text pasting reliability**: Different apps may handle input differently
3. **Wayland support on Linux**: Limited protocol support
4. **Permission flows**: User experience critical for adoption

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Early platform testing**: Test keyboard and text input on all platforms early
2. **Fallback mechanisms**: Provide clipboard method if direct input fails
3. **Clear error messages**: Guide users through permission setup
4. **Incremental implementation**: Test each component independently before integration

---

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Transcription latency**: < 2 seconds (small model, typical clips)
- **Widget animations**: 60fps
- **Audio visualization**: 30-60fps
- **History search**: < 100ms
- **Memory usage**: < 100MB for 5-minute recording
- **Battery impact**: Minimal when idle

### Functional Targets
- **Cross-platform support**: 100% feature parity on macOS, Windows, Linux (X11)
- **Transcription accuracy**: Match main app Whisper quality
- **System-wide operation**: Works in all major applications (browsers, editors, chat)
- **User satisfaction**: Intuitive, fast, reliable dictation experience

---

## Notes

- **Leverage Existing Code**: Maximize reuse of whisper-rs, audio.rs, transcribe.rs, config.rs patterns
- **Privacy-First**: All history stored locally, no cloud sync, no telemetry
- **Incremental Testing**: Each task group includes focused tests (2-8 tests) to verify functionality
- **Test Strategy**: Write minimal tests during development (2-8 per group), then add up to 10 strategic integration tests at the end
- **Platform Consistency**: Ensure consistent behavior across macOS, Windows, Linux despite API differences
- **User Experience**: Smooth animations, clear feedback, graceful error handling
